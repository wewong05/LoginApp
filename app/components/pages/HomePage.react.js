					<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate">react-boilerplate</a> as a starting point — the app thus uses Redux, PostCSS, react-router, ServiceWorker, AppCache, bcrypt and lots more. See the full source code on <a href="https://github.com/mxstbr/login-flow">Github</a>!</p>

				<h2>Features</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader"><strong>react-hot-loader</strong></a>, your changes in the CSS and JS get reflected in the app instantly without refreshing the page. That means that the <strong>current application state persists</strong> even when you change something in the underlying code! For a very good explanation and demo watch Dan Abramov himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs">talking about it at react-europe</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a href="https://github.com/gaearon/redux"><strong>Redux</strong></a> is a much better implementation of a flux–like, unidirectional data flow. Redux makes actions composable, reduces the boilerplate code and makes hot–reloading possible in the first place. For a good overview of redux check out the talk linked above or the <a href="https://gaearon.github.io/redux/">official documentation</a>!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a href="https://github.com/postcss/postcss"><strong>PostCSS</strong></a> is like Sass, but modular and capable of much more. PostCSS is, in essence, just a wrapper for plugins which exposes an easy to use, but very powerful API. While it is possible to <a href="https://github.com/jonathantneal/precss">replicate Sass features</a> with PostCSS, PostCSS has an <a href="http://postcss.parts">ecosystem of amazing plugins</a> with functionalities Sass cannot even dream about having.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a href="https://github.com/rackt/react-router"><strong>react-router</strong></a> is used for routing in this boilerplate. react-router makes routing really easy to do and takes care of a lot of the work.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/"><strong>ServiceWorker</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/"><strong>AppCache</strong></a> make it possible to use the application offline. As soon as the website has been opened once, it is cached and available without a network connection. <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen"><strong><code>manifest.json</code></strong></a> is specifically for Chrome on Android. Users can add the website to the homescreen and use it like a native app!</p>
