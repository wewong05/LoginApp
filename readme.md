# Base Application 

This application is for prototyping the client web application with

1) Navigation Bar (Top)
2) Footer Bar (Bottom)
3) Main Container 
4) Login Flow

# Standard
1) ES6 also known as ES2015 will be used (will clean up the code in later part)
2) extension react.js will be used instead of .js temporarily so as for slightly easier debugging in Sublime Text (will change all to .jsx for consistency)
